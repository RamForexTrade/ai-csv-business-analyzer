- 🌿 **Current Branch**: `advanced-features`
- 📧 **Email Config**: Configured for TeakWood Business

## 🔧 Option 2: Manual Commands

If you prefer to run commands manually:

# 1. Navigate to your repository
cd "C:\01_Projects\Teakwood_Business\Web_Scraping\Rel3a_Deployment\ai-csv-business-analyzer"

# 2. Check current status
git status

# 3. Add all files (respects .gitignore)
git add .

# 4. Commit changes
git commit -m "Local development setup complete - advanced-features branch"

# 5. Push to GitHub
git push origin advanced-features
```

## 🔍 What Gets Pushed:
✅ **Included Files:**
- All Python source code (.py files)
- Configuration files (email_config.py, requirements.txt, etc.)
- Documentation files (.md files)
- Project structure and modules

❌ **Excluded Files (by .gitignore):**
- `.env` file (your API keys stay local)
- `ai-csv-env/` directory (virtual environment)
- `__pycache__/` directories
- Data files (*.csv, *.xlsx)

## 🎯 After Pushing:
1. **Check GitHub**: Visit https://github.com/RamForexTrade/ai-csv-business-analyzer/tree/advanced-features
2. **Verify Branch**: Should see your advanced-features branch with all files
3. **Ready for Development**: You can now add new features to this branch

## 🛠️ Next Steps After Push:
- Add new features to the advanced-features branch
- Test locally with `streamlit run ai_csv_analyzer.py`
- Commit and push changes as you develop
- Deploy to Railway when ready
- Merge to main branch when features are complete

## ⚠️ Important Notes:
- Your local `.env` file with API keys will NOT be pushed (it's in .gitignore)
- The `email_config.py` file WILL be pushed (but this is intended for the app to work)
- Your virtual environment `ai-csv-env/` will NOT be pushed (it's in .gitignore)
